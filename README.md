# HanzeProject
This repository contains the code and exercises from the topics I’ve studied while learning Python and Artificial Intelligence.
It serves as a place to organize and keep track of all the scripts, notebooks, and small projects I’ve worked on.

Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or concept explored during my learning process.
